This is my master thesis with the title "Geospatial Analysis on Fuel Prices in the Greek Market" under the supervision of Dr. Athanasios Stavrakoudis.

Abstract: This thesis undertook an extensive analysis on a national scale to discern
trends and correlations in fuel prices across diverse community
types in Greece. This investigation proved crucial for a comprehensive
understanding of the Greek market dynamics and the nuanced influences
on fuel price fluctuations from neighboring communities, municipalities,
islands, and other geographical entities. The analysis spanned
nearly a decade, covering the period from 2014 to 2023, necessitating
the amalgamation of diverse datasets encompassing fuel-related
information, census data, and geospatial details of various community
types. Subsequent to the assembly of these datasets, a series of meticulous
data preprocessing steps were executed to align the data for both
general analysis and time-series clustering. A central aspect of the
study involved the application of K-means clustering to different levels
of communities, shedding light on the similarity of fuel types among
them. The calculation of clusters was facilitated through the implementation
of dynamic time warping (DTW) to construct the DTW
matrix, a crucial component for time-series clustering. The ensuing
presentation of clustering results offered valuable insights into the correlations
and resemblances among fuel prices across distinct communities,
prefectures, island communities, islands and island complexes.
